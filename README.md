### What I learned

I am using this section to recap over some of my major learnings while working through this project. I feel writing these out and providing code samples of areas I want to highlight is a great way to reinforce my own knowledge.

- **Q Objects**
  To execute more complex queries with django ORM (for example, queries with OR statements) you need to use Q objects. I used them at multiple places in my views and they make up my simple search feature work.
  
  ```python
  # My simple search query 
  # Here Q with | works similar to LIKE OR query of SQL
  #Note: __contains __(case-sensitive) and icontains (case-insensitive)
  results = Email.objects.filter(user=request.user)\
    .filter(Q(sender__email__icontains=query)
    | Q(sender__first_name__icontains=query)
    | Q(sender__last_name__icontains=query)
    | Q(subject__icontains=query)
    | Q(body__icontains=query)).distinct()
  ```
- **JsonResponse**
  JsonResponse is an HttpResponse subclass that helps to create a JSON-encoded response. Based on my usecase it enabled me to make a simple API with a serializer inside my model that returns the data in required JSON format.
  ```python
  # views.py
  def mailbox(request, mailbox):
    #skipped some code here
    return JsonResponse([email.serialize() for email in emails], safe=False)

  #models.py
  class Email(models.Model):
    #skipped some code here
    def serialize(self):
        return {
            "id": self.id,
            "username": self.sender.first_name +" "+self.sender.last_name,
            "sender": self.sender.email,
            "recipients": [user.first_name +" "+user.last_name for user in self.recipients.all()],
            "subject": self.subject,
            "body": self.body,
            "timestamp": self.timestamp.strftime("%b %d-%Y-%H:%M %p" ),
            "read": self.read,
            "archived": self.archived,
            "starred": self.starred,
            "deleted": self.deleted,
        }
  ```
- **History Api**
  Single page applications do not re-render pages rather they make changes to the page asynchronously. While this feature looks appealing to the user the state of the website is no longer saved by the browser as it is done with multi-page websites. So inorder to make the back and forward history buttons of the browser the history API is used.

  To use the browser’s history functionality, you begin by telling the browser to remember your initial state. This requires the replaceState method
  ```js
  // Initial State
  // To use the browser’s history functionality, 
  // you begin by telling the browser to remember your initial state.
  history.replaceState({ mailbox: "inbox" }, "Default state", "#inbox"); 

  //Behind the scenes, The History Api uses a Stack data structure.

  //Pushstate pushes states to the stack
  history.pushState({ mailbox: mailbox }, "", `./#${mailbox}`);

  //Popstate pop states out of the stack
  window.addEventListener("popstate", (e) => {
        load_mailbox(e.state.mailbox); //Popstate
    }
  ```


### Continued development

I am using this section to outline areas that I want to continue focusing on in future for this project. 

**Tasks To Do**
- [ ] Loading Spinners
- [ ] ML model to detect spam mails
- [ ] Pagination + Infinite Scroll 
- [ ] Code Refactoring

### Achievements
- My teacher and CSS Expert kevin powell by whom i learned responsive design praised my the design of my gmail clone and he loved it.
- [Link to the video](https://youtu.be/3FU-pY5BzKs)

### Useful resources
- [Q object docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/db/queries/#complex-lookups-with-q-objects) - This is the django doc i reffered for understanding Q objects.
- [History Api](https://medium.com/@george.norberg/history-api-getting-started-36bfc82ddefc) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand History Api. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
